**Singly linked list implementation in C++**


*A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is **unidirectional**, that is, it can be **traversed[access elements]** in only one direction from head to the last node (tail).*

*Each element in a linked list is called a **node.** A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.*

*The first node is called the **head**; it points to the first node of the list and helps us access every other element in the list. The last node, also sometimes called the **tail**, points to NULL which helps us in determining when the list ends.*

**Basic Operations on Singly Linked List**
<ol>
<li><b>Transversal</b>: To traverse all the nodes one after another.</li>
<li><b>Insertion</b>: To add a node at the given position.</li>
<li><b>Deletion</b>: To delete a node.</li>
<li><b>Sorting</b>: To arrange nodes in a linked list in a specific order.</b></li>
<li><b>Updating</b>: To update a node</li>
<li><b>Searching</b>: To search an element(s) by value.</li>
<li><b>Merging</b>: To merge two linked lists into one.</li>
</ol>
